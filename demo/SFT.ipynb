If none is passed, the trainer will retrieve that value from the tokenizer. Some tokenizers do not provide a default value, so there is a check to retrieve the minimum between 2048 and that value. Make sure to check it before training.\n",
    "- For training adapters in 8bit, you might need to tweak the arguments of the `prepare_model_for_kbit_training` method from PEFT, hence we advise users to use `prepare_in_int8_kwargs` field, or create the PeftModel outside the [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.9.4/en/sft_trainer#trl.SFTTrainer) and pass it.\n",
    "- For a more memory-efficient training using adapters, you can load the base model in 8bit, for that simply add `load_in_8bit` argument when creating the [SFTTrainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/v0.9.4/en/sft_trainer#trl.SFTTrainer), or create a base model in 8bit outside the trainer and pass it.\n",
    "- If you create a model outside the trainer, make sure to not pass to the trainer any additional keyword arguments that are relative to `from_pretrained()` method.\n",
    "## Multi-GPU Training\n",
    "Trainer (and thus SFTTrainer) supports multi-GPU training. If you run your script with python script.py it will default to using DP as the strategy, which may be [slower than expected](https://github.com/huggingface/trl/issues/1303). To use DDP (which is generally recommended, see [here](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/perf_train_gpu_many?select-gpu=Accelerate#data-parallelism) for more info) you must launch the script with `python -m torch.distributed.launch script.py` or `accelerate launch script.py`. For DDP to work you must also check the following:\n",
    "- If you’re using gradient_checkpointing, add the following to the TrainingArguments: `gradient_checkpointing_kwargs={'use_reentrant':False}` (more info here\n",
    "- Ensure that the model is placed on the correct device\n",
    "## GPTQ Conversion\n",
    "You may experience some issues with GPTQ Quantization after completing training. Lowering `gradient_accumulation_steps` to 4 will resolve most issues during the quantization process to GPTQ format.\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "In the SFTTrainer we smartly support `datasets.IterableDataset` in addition to other style datasets. This is useful if you are using large corpora that you do not want to save all to disk. The data will be tokenized and processed on the fly, even when packing is enabled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, in the SFTTrainer, we support pre-tokenized datasets if they are `datasets.Dataset` or `datasets.IterableDataset`. In other words, if such a dataset has a column of `input_ids`, no further processing (tokenization or packing) will be done, and the dataset will be used as-is. This can be useful if you have pretokenized your dataset outside of this script and want to re-use it directly."
