    "# Fine-tune a pretrained model\n",
    "There are significant benefits to using a pretrained model. It reduces computation costs, your carbon footprint, and allows you to use state-of-the-art models without having to train one from scratch. Transformers provides access to thousands of pretrained models for a wide range of tasks. When you use a pretrained model, you train it on a dataset specific to your task. This is known as fine-tuning, an incredibly powerful training technique. In this tutorial, you will fine-tune a pretrained model with a deep learning framework of your choice:\n",
    "- Fine-tune a pretrained model with Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.41.3/en/main_classes/trainer#transformers.Trainer).\n",
    "- Fine-tune a pretrained model in TensorFlow with Keras.\n",
    "- Fine-tune a pretrained model in native PyTorch.\n",
    "## Prepare a dataset\n",
    "Before you can fine-tune a pretrained model, download a dataset and prepare it for training. The previous tutorial showed you how to process data for training, and now you get an opportunity to put those skills to the test!\n",

But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\\\\nThe manager was rude when giving me my order.
