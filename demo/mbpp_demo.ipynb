    "## Dataset Summary\n",
    "The benchmark consists of around 1,000 crowd-sourced Python programming problems, designed to be solvable by entry level programmers, covering programming fundamentals, standard library functionality, and so on. Each problem consists of a task description, code solution and 3 automated test cases. As described in the paper, a subset of the data has been hand-verified by us.\n",
